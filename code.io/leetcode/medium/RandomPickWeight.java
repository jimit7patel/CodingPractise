You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers w where w[i] describes the weight of the ith index.

You need to implement the function pickIndex(), which randomly picks an index in the range [0, w.length - 1] (inclusive) and returns it. The probability of picking an index i is w[i] / sum(w).

For example, if w = [1, 3], the probability of picking index 0 is 1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25 (i.e., 25%), and the probability of picking index 1 is 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75 (i.e., 75%).


Example 1:

Input
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. The only option is to return 0 since there is only one element in w.
*/
public class RandomPickWeight {
/*
* Use accumulated freq array to get idx.
w[] = {2,5,3,4} => wsum[] = {2,7,10,14}
then get random val random.nextInt(14)+1, idx is in range [1,14]

idx in [1,2] return 0
idx in [3,7] return 1
idx in [8,10] return 2
idx in [11,14] return 3
use binarySearch to return the idx

    Random random;
    int[] wSums;

    public RandomPickWeight(int[] w) {
        this.random = new Random();
        for(int i=1; i<w.length; ++i)
            w[i] += w[i-1];
        this.wSums = w;
    }

    public int pickIndex() {
        int len = wSums.length;
        int idx = random.nextInt(wSums[len-1]) + 1;
        int left = 0, right = len - 1;
        // search position
        while(left <= right){
            int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
            if(wSums[mid] == idx)
                return mid;
            else if(wSums[mid] < idx)
                left = mid + 1;
